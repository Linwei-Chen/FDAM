# FDAM: Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation

**[ICCV 2025]** Official implementation of *Frequency-Dynamic Attention Modulation for Dense Prediction* [(paper link)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12006).

FDAM revitalizes Vision Transformers by tackling frequency vanishing. It dynamically modulates the frequency response of attention layers, enabling the model to preserve critical details and textures for superior dense prediction performance.



# ðŸ“° News

- **2025-10-10** : Training code and weights for DeiT-III-Base on ADE20K are now available.



## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Attention Inversion (AttInv):** Inspired by circuit theory, AttInv inverts the inherent low-pass filter of the attention mechanism to generate a complementary high-pass filter, enabling a full-spectrum representation.
- **Frequency Dynamic Scaling (FreqScale):** Adaptively re-weights and amplifies different frequency bands in feature maps, providing fine-grained control to enhance crucial details like edges and textures.
- **Prevents Representation Collapse:** Effectively mitigates frequency vanishing and rank collapse in deep ViTs, leading to more diverse and discriminative features.
- **Plug-and-Play & Efficient:** Seamlessly integrates into existing ViT architectures (like DeiT, SegFormer, MaskDINO) with minimal computational overhead.

## ðŸ›  Installation

Our implementation is built on top of [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) and [MMDetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection). To ensure compatibility, we recommend following this step-by-step guide.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PyTorch 1.11.0
- CUDA 11.3

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid package conflicts.

```bash
# Using conda
conda create -n fdam python=3.8 -y
conda activate fdam

# Using venv
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install PyTorch
Install PyTorch and its companion libraries, ensuring they are compatible with CUDA 11.3.

```bash
pip install torch==1.11.0+cu113 torchvision==0.12.0+cu113 torchaudio==0.11.0 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
```

### 4. Install OpenMMLab Dependencies

Install `mmcv-full`, which is a prerequisite for MMDetection and MMSegmentation.

```bash
pip install mmcv-full==1.5.3 -f https://download.openmmlab.com/mmcv/dist/cu113/torch1.11.0/index.html
```
Next, install MMDetection and MMSegmentation.

```bash
pip install mmsegmentation==0.25.0
```

### 5. Clone and Install FDAM
Finally, clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/FDAM.git
